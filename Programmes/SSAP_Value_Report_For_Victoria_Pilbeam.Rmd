### Skipjack science lifting economic ceiling

SPC's Skipjack Survey and Assessment Programme (SSAP) ran from 1977 until 1981 and measured for the first time the size of the skipjack tuna fishery. The Programme was funded from approximately US$3 million of donor funding, which was approximately 33% of SPC's total funding at the time. In 1977, SPC was a small organisation which had no experience in undertaking such an ambitious piece of advanced applied scientific research. Nor was it organisationally equipped or experienced with undertaking technical work of this size. 

SSAP greatly expanded the world's knowledge of the biology of skipjack and other tuna species. It quantified for the first time the large size of the skipjack resource in the Western and Central Pacific, estimated at around 3 million tonnes of fishing biomass.

The value of the 1977 work to pacific countries, producers and consumers has been immense. The overwhelming growth of the pacific activity is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:PurseSeineBoats).

```{r PurseSeineBoats, echo=FALSE, fig.pos='h', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = 'Number of Purse Seine Vessels Operating in the WCPFO Purse Seine Fishery'}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BaseDir, "Number_of_Purse_Seine_Vessels_Operating_within_the_WCPFC_NoTitles.png"))

```

Between 1977 and 1980, the number of distant water nation purse seine vessels fishing the pacific increased from `r sum(Vessels$vessels[Vessels$YY == 1977])` to `r sum(Vessels$vessels[Vessels$YY == 1980])`. Between 1980 and 1982, they had increased again by a further `r sum(Vessels$vessels[Vessels$YY == 1982])-sum(Vessels$vessels[Vessels$YY == 1980])` vessels. And in 1983 the total number of purse seine vessels working the pacific became `r sum(Vessels$vessels[Vessels$YY == 1983])`.

The growth in fishing activity far exceeded any indicative comparative growth rates. either additive growth from the pre-SSAP (1972 – 1997) extrapolated into the future, or from exponential vessel growth rates between 1977 – 2023.

Increased fishing activity extracted increasing volumes of mainly skipjack tuna from the pacific, making the pacific the overwhelming source of the world’s tuna supply (Figure \@ref(fig:WorldVolumes)).


```{r WorldVolumes, echo=FALSE, fig.pos='h', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Global Annual Skipjack Tuna Catch Volumes"}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BaseDir, "World_Volumes_WithoutTitles.png"))

### The Value of Harvested Pacific Skipjack
The Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) estimate the value of tuna extracted from the Pacific.[^FFAData] Unfortunately, value information prior 1997 is unavailable, so the FFA metrics only provide a partial picture of the value of the economic potential generated by the SSAP programme.

```{r PresentValue, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(Present_Value_Pretty,
               row.names = FALSE,
               format = "markdown",
               align = c('lcccc'),
               booktabs = TRUE,
               caption= "Present Value of Historical Catch Value")
```
Assuming a conservative 3% potential investment rate then, over the shortened timeframe of the available catch value statistics, the current day nominal value of the historically skipjack harvest since `r Present_Value_Pretty$Year[1]` is approximately US`r Present_Value_Pretty[nrow(Present_Value_Pretty),length(Present_Value_Pretty)]` million in 2024. 

In comparison, if the initial US$3 million SSAP investment made in 1977 was invested at 3% per annual, it would be worth `r 
 paste0("US$", format(round(Present_Value(Start_Date  = 1977,
                 End_Date    = Current_Date,
                 Start_Value = 3,
                 Interest_Rate = Interest_Rate)),big.mark   = ",")) ` million in today's nominal dollars. 
                 
The initial US$3 million investment has generated a compounding average nominal rate of return of
`r paste0(round((((Total_Present_Value / Science_cost)^(1/(2024 - 1977)))-1)*1000)/10, "%")` per annum since 1977. 

And that is without measure the value of the harvested skipjack between 1997 and `r Present_Value_Pretty$Year[1]`!

### Returning Value to Pacific Countries
Access fees received by pacific countries in 2021 (or the latest year for which data are available) were approximately US$515 million: approximately 26.8% of the value of the regional offshore catch.  Table \@ref(tab:GovtRevs), from the Benefish Study 1[^BenefishO] and 4[^Benefish] reports provide a partial picture into the growth in fishing-generated licensing fees. 

```{r GovtRevs, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(Government_Revenues,
               row.names = FALSE,
               format = "markdown",
               align = c('lccccc'),
               booktabs = TRUE,
               caption= "Access fees for offshore fishing 2007–202 (or latest year)")
```

No report prior to the Benefish Study 1 report compiled the fishing access fees from SPC countries into a single table. However, from Table \@ref(tab:GovtRevs), its clear that prior to the introduction of the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) in 2007 significantly increased access fees. 

Benefish Study 4 notes that although VDS commenced in December 2007, it wasn't fully implementated until 2012.[^VDS] Early in the scheme access fees were derived from predominately foreign fleets as governments sort to encourage their domestic offshore fishing industries. However, with the growth in the various domestic vessel numbers (Figure \@ref(fig:PurseSeineBoats)), governments are now receiving access fees from all vessels active in their waters.
