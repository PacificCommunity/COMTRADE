# COMTRADE
Background:
This project accesses Comtrade and FFA data. 

Comtrade is a United Nations trade database(https://comtradeplus.un.org/), which needs an API to access. Currently, I've got mine hardcoded, but all that will change. 
The FFA data is derived from https://www.ffa.int/publications-and-statistics/statistics/


Objective:
I'm hoping to use this information to start making both throughput measures, and estimates of "world demand".

The theory goes that the value of fish trade depends on its world price. Not just Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) feed into world volumes. Understanding world price dynamics with respect to traded volumes would help understand PICT fisheries economics.
